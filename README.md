# Theoretical Neuroscience Answers
I'm taking a crack through [Dayan & Abbott's _Theoretical Neuroscience_](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/book/) ([PDF](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf)). These are my answers to the exercises. Feel free to have a look! I'm also using this as a chance to get familiar with [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
